# Issues

- save: ok but errors
    is_editable_instance: Condition "!is_a_parent_of(p_node)" is true. Returned: false
- load: how to merge scene
- better to just save a list of id and coords and flips myself?
  - how does tile_data combine those three into one int array?

## Todo

- fix merge with loop
- fix error!?
- fuck it all and go back to saving in json
  - make test using json too
- test if flip is saved!?
